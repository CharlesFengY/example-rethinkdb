To run the test cases, first you need to install the following dependencies:
- Java 8
- Docker 1.13+
- Maven 3.x

Also make sure you can run docker commands with the user you are running the tests with. For more information check

After installing all the dependencies, you can run the test cases using:

```console
$ mvn test
```
